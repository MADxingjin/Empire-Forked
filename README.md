# For 1.5

I have been working on this for a few days, I managed to get it to at least load in game and lightly test a few functions.  Will continue to work on it.

# Empire-Mod
This is the repository for the Empire mod Ludeon Studio's topdown base building-exploration game RimWorld.
The Mod features the ability to found and manage your own empire in order to assist the player in his daily endeavours.
This mod was initially developed by Saakra, a lone Mod Dev. He has since moved on due to IRL issues and handed over the reigns of development to the community.
